## Features of EWARM 6.5
 
Some of the main features of EWARM 6.5 are:
 
- Support for over 8,000 Arm devices from all major vendors and selected 64-bit Arm cores, including Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M33, Cortex-M55, Cortex-M85, Cortex-R4, Cortex-R5, Cortex-R7, Cortex-R8, Cortex-R52, Cortex-R52+, Cortex-R82, Cortex-A5, Cortex-A7, Cortex-A8, Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15, Cortex-A35, Cortex-A53, Cortex-A55, Cortex-A57, Cortex-A72 and Arm11, Arm9, Arm7 and SecurCore[^1^].
- Leading compiler technology that generates fast and compact code with advanced global and target-specific optimizations[^1^]. The compiler supports C and C++ languages and a wide range of industry-standard debug and image formats[^1^].
- Comprehensive debugger that provides an Arm instruction simulator and extensive support for debugging probes and target systems[^1^]. The debugger includes RTOS plugins and wide support for communication stacks and middleware[^1^]. It also offers multicore debugging with support for symmetric multicore processing (SMP) and asymmetric multicore processing (AMP)[^1^].
- Integrated code analysis add-ons that help you to ensure code quality throughout the development and testing process[^1^]. The static analysis add-on C-STAT checks your code for compliance with coding standards such as MISRA C:2012 and CWE[^1^]. The runtime analysis add-on C-RUN checks your code for memory leaks, arithmetic errors and array bounds violations[^1^].
- On-demand training included when you buy a license of EWARM 6.5[^1^]. You get access to free training courses through the IAR Academy on Demand offering[^1^].

## Benefits of EWARM 6.5
 
Some of the benefits of using EWARM 6.5 for your Arm development are:

- You can develop code for a wide range of Arm devices with one toolchain[^1^]. You can easily switch between different devices and projects without losing your settings or configurations[^1^].
- You can generate code that is fast, compact and reliable with the leading compiler technology[^1^]. You can also fine-tune your code with target-specific optimizations and linker options[^1^].
- You can debug your code efficiently and effectively with the comprehensive debugger[^1^]. You can use the simulator or various debugging probes to connect to your target system[^1^]. You can also use the multicore debugging features to debug complex applications with multiple cores[^1^].
- You can improve your code quality with the integrated code analysis add-ons[^1^]. You can detect and fix potential errors and vulnerabilities in your code before they cause problems in runtime or testing[^1^]. You can also ensure compliance with coding standards and best practices[^1^].
- You can learn new skills and techniques with the on-demand training included in your license[^1^]. You can access free training courses anytime and anywhere through the IAR Academy on Demand platform[^1^].

## Conclusion
 
EWARM 6.5 is a powerful and user-friendly development environment for Arm-based embedded systems.
